/**
 * Reads vault data for each `IMetaMorpho` entry that has an owner in `includedOwners`. For non-included ones,
 * only the `owner` field is read to save gas.
 *
 * @param metaMorphos Array of `IMetaMorpho`s to search through and (possibly) read as a vault.
 * @param includedOwners Array of owners whose vaults should be included in the returned array.
 * This helper function will make sure it's unique and sorted before passing to contract.
 *
 * @example
 * // Use with viem's deployless option (special bytecode `data` for `eth_call`; `to` is left undefined)
 * const { data } = useReadContract({
 *   chainId,
 *   ...readAccrualVaults(morphoAddress, metaMorphoAddresses, includedOwnersList, true),
 * });
 *
 * @example
 * // Use with `stateOverride`
 * const { data } = useReadContract({
 *   chainId,
 *   ...readAccrualVaults(morphoAddress, metaMorphoAddresses, includedOwnersList),
 *   stateOverride: [readAccrualVaultsStateOverride()],
 * });
 *
 * @example
 * // Use with multicall -- MUST use `stateOverride` rather than viem's deployless option
 * const { data } = useReadContracts({
 *   contracts: includedOwnersLists
 *     .map((includedOwnersList) => [
 *       { chainId, ...readAccrualVaults(morphoAddress, metaMorphoAddresses, includedOwnersList) },
 *     ])
 *     .flat(),
 *   allowFailure: false,
